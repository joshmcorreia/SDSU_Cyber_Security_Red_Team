# SDSU Cyber Security Red Team - CS574

## Purpose
As leader of the SDSU CS574 Cyber Security Red Team I have made a bunch of custom tools for attacking students' systems. I am publishing this publicly so that students who have completed the course are able to learn from the tools that I created.

I originally took this course in 2019 and was assigned to Red Team because of some of the real-world applications I demonstrated to the professor, Peter Bartoli. Ever since graduating I have been great friends with Peter and I continue to lead the Red Team every semester.
